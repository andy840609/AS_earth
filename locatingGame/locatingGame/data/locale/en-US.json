    "intro": "Earthquakes are usually caused by sudden movements along fault planes beneath the earth's surface. The location where the fault begins to rupture is called the focus, while the point on the surface directly above the focus is called the epicenter. In this game, the focus is where the 'big bad guy' is causing trouble. Your mission is to find the location of the big bad guy. To do this, we need to first gather information from seismic stations. By estimating the distance to the epicenter from the arrival times of P-waves and S-waves, we can determine the possible location of the epicenter. With the epicenter location, we can locate the focus underground and find the lair of the big bad guy. Answering the earthquake knowledge questions correctly will defeat the big bad guy and complete the mission to earn a certificate. Earthquake disaster prevention relies on you! Good luck!",

    "questInfo0": "Earthquake Location refers to using the seismic wave arrival time data recorded by seismic stations to estimate the time, location, and depth of an earthquake. With the earthquake's location, we can further estimate its magnitude.",
    "questInfo1": "Official earthquake reports from the Central Weather Bureau Earthquake Reporting Center typically include:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The time of the earthquake (local time in Taipei)\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Coordinates of the epicenter\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Geographic description of the epicenter\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Depth of the earthquake\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Magnitude of the earthquake\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Intensity in various locations\nAdditional information may include aftershock intensity maps, fault rupture mechanisms (also known as focal mechanism solutions), and more.",
    "questInfo2": "1. Epicenter and Focus:\nWhen describing the earthquake's location, there are two terms: 'Focus' refers to the point underground where the fault begins to rupture or move, while the 'Epicenter' is the point on the surface directly above the focus. The distance between the focus and the epicenter is the earthquake's depth.\n\n2. Magnitude and Intensity:\nWhen describing an earthquake's size, 'Magnitude' and 'Intensity' are commonly used terms. Magnitude represents the energy released by the earthquake. An earthquake has only one magnitude value, which does not change with location, but different magnitude scales exist. The Richter scale (ML) used by Taiwan is a common scale; whereas 'Intensity' refers to the shaking level experienced in various locations during the earthquake. The intensity may vary depending on the distance from the epicenter or differences in surface layers. Earlier, intensity was determined based on human perception or damage to buildings. Now, it is quantitatively calculated based on the maximum ground acceleration and velocity. The Central Weather Bureau released a new intensity grading table in 2020. For details, please refer to the bureau's information.",
    "questInfo3": "Earthquake location requires three components:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Coordinates of each seismic station.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Arrival times of seismic waves at each station.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. 'Velocity structure' underground.\nWe interpret the arrival times of seismic waves from the recorded waveform data and compare them with the 'theoretical arrival times' calculated based on the velocity structure. By continuously improving the 'trial location' to align the theoretical arrival times with the observed arrival times, we can determine the focus's location.",
    "questInfo4": "Seismic waves received by a station include various types of waves, with two major categories being Body Waves and Surface Waves. Body Waves, such as P-waves and S-waves, penetrate underground and provide information about the Earth's internal structure. Surface Waves are confined to the Earth's shallow layers and usually have the highest amplitude and longest period due to their two-dimensional energy dispersion, compared to the three-dimensional dispersion of Body Waves.",
    "questInfo5": "Body Waves are divided into P-waves and S-waves. P-waves (Primary waves) are longitudinal waves, so if seismic waves are broken into this type, they will be the first to arrive at a seismic station, as they move through solid, liquid, and gas media. S-waves (Secondary waves) are transverse waves, which arrive after P-waves as they move only through solid media. The speed of P-waves is usually faster than S-waves. Surface Waves include Love waves and Rayleigh waves. Love waves are shear waves moving horizontally with particles vibrating perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Rayleigh waves cause particles to move in an elliptical path, resulting in vertical and horizontal displacements along the wave's propagation direction, with the wave having a slower speed than Body Waves.",
    "questInfo6": "The waveform data received by seismic stations is typically recorded in three components: east-west, north-south, and vertical. The east-west and north-south components are horizontal vectors. Since P-waves primarily appear in the vertical component and arrive first, the time of P-wave arrival is usually identified as the point of significant initial large oscillations in the vertical waveform. S-waves are more evident and have larger amplitude and slightly lower frequency in the horizontal waveforms, so their arrival time is usually identified as the point where the amplitude becomes larger and slightly more spaced out in the east-west or north-south waveforms. The image below shows a waveform recorded at the Yeheng Station in Taoyuan County, serving as an example of identifying P-waves and S-waves, with the earthquake located 125 km away off the coast of Hualien.",
    "questInfo7": "When an earthquake's depth is relatively shallow (less than about 30 km), the arrival times of P-waves and S-waves are usually positively correlated with the 'epicentral distance' (the distance between the epicenter and the station) (Figure 1). Thus, the time difference between the arrival of P-waves and S-waves at the same station ('Ts-Tp') also shows a positive correlation with the epicentral distance (Figure 2). In other words, based on the observed time difference between P-waves and S-waves at the same station, we can roughly estimate the epicentral distance. \nFigure 1: Waveform diagrams for each component of stations arranged by epicentral distance (left: vertical, center and right: horizontal), with the blue line indicating the P-wave arrival time and the red line indicating the S-wave arrival time.\n\nFigure 2: The time difference between P- and S-waves (Ts-Tp) shows a linear relationship with the epicentral distance.",
    "questInfo8": "A simplified method is to first identify the P-wave and S-wave arrival times from the station records, then estimate the epicentral distance based on the time difference between P-wave and S-wave arrivals (Ts-Tp) (see Q8). The location of the epicenter is likely to be at a distance from the station equal to the epicentral distance. In other words, if you draw a circle with the station as the center and the epicentral distance as the radius on a map, any point on the circumference is a possible location of the epicenter. Once you have the time differences from three (or more) stations, you can draw three (or more) circles, and the intersection of these circles should indicate the epicenter's location. Since the constant used to estimate the epicentral distance from Ts-Tp is related to the earthquake's depth and geological structure, this constant value varies with each earthquake. Generally, the epicentral distance (in km) is approximately Ts-Tp (in seconds) multiplied by 7.5 to 8.5 (km/s). This method is suitable for estimating shallow earthquakes but not deep ones.\n\nIllustration of earthquake location: Multiply the time difference between P- and S-waves (Ts-Tp) by an empirical constant (~8 km/s) to estimate the epicentral distance. If there are three or more stations, circles with radii equal to the epicentral distance should roughly intersect at one point. This intersection is highly likely to be the epicenter location."
